## Python Piscine for Datascience
- Welcome to Python Piscine for Datascience â€” a hands-on project where I explored the fundamentals of Python programming with a focus on data manipulation and visualization.

## ðŸ“˜ What the Projects is about / What I Learned
- Python Basics: Variables, control structures, functions, and working with files.
- NumPy: Creating and transforming arrays, slicing, broadcasting, and performing mathematical operations on data.
- Matplotlib: Plotting data to visualize trends, distributions, and relationships.
- Image Manipulation: Working with image data as arrays to perform basic transformations and filtering.
- Object-Oriented Programming: Understanding and applying classes, methods, and inheritance in Python.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Highlights
- Converted raw data into useful visual insights.
- Manipulated image arrays for simple graphic transformations.
- Built and used custom Python classes to organize code and functionality.
